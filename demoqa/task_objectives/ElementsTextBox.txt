Test Automation Portfolio Project: Comprehensive Web Testing with Robot Framework and Browser Library

Test Plan: Text Box Validation

Objective:
To validate the functionality and user experience of the text boxes on the practice website (https://demoqa.com/),
specifically focusing on the Full Name, Email, Current Address, and Permanent Address input fields.
The test plan will ensure that the fields can handle various input scenarios and that the submit button displays the correct output format.

Test Scenarios:

Empty input fields

Description: Submit the form with all input fields left empty
Expected Result: The output section should not display any text
Input only in Full Name field

Description: Enter a name in the Full Name field, leaving other fields empty, and submit the form
Expected Result: The output section should display the name with the correct label (Name: [Full Name])
Input only in Email field with a valid email address

Description: Enter a valid email address in the Email field, leaving other fields empty, and submit the form
Expected Result: The output section should display the email address with the correct label (Email: [Email])
Input only in Email field with an invalid email address

Description: Enter an invalid email address in the Email field, leaving other fields empty, and submit the form
Expected Result: The form should display an error message indicating that the email format is incorrect
Input only in Current Address field

Description: Enter text in the Current Address field, leaving other fields empty, and submit the form
Expected Result: The output section should display the current address with the correct label (Current Address: [Current Address])
Input only in Permanent Address field

Description: Enter text in the Permanent Address field, leaving other fields empty, and submit the form
Expected Result: The output section should display the permanent address with the correct label (Permanent Address: [Permanent Address])
Input in all fields with a valid email address

Description: Fill in all input fields with valid information and submit the form
Expected Result: The output section should display all entered information with the correct labels
Input in all fields with an invalid email address

Description: Fill in all input fields with valid information, except for an invalid email address, and submit the form
Expected Result: The form should display an error message indicating that the email format is incorrect
Long input in all fields

Description: Enter a long string of text in each input field (exceeding typical input length) and submit the form
Expected Result: The output section should display all entered information with the correct labels, without any truncation or loss of data
Test Execution:
The test plan will be executed using the Robot Framework and Browser Library, following best practices for test automation. The test scripts will be written in a modular and maintainable manner, allowing for easy modification and expansion in the future.
