Test Automation Portfolio Project: Comprehensive Web Testing with Robot Framework and Browser Library

Introduction:

I am excited to present my test automation portfolio project,
which showcases my proficiency in using the Robot Framework and Browser Library for web testing.
In this project, I have focused on the practice website (https://demoqa.com/)
which offers a comprehensive range of web elements and features to test.
The website is organized into six subcategories:

Elements
Forms
Alerts, Frame & Windows
Widgets
Interactions
Book Store Application
Each subcategory presents unique challenges and opportunities to demonstrate my expertise
in handling various types of web objects and interactions. To exhibit the depth of my knowledge and skills,
I have created test automation cases for each subcategory.

The goal of this project is to validate the functionality and usability of the website's features
and ensure they meet the highest quality standards. Through the implementation of Robot Framework
and Browser Library, I aim to achieve a high level of test coverage, maintainability, and reusability.

By following industry best practices for test automation, this project highlights my ability
to create well-structured, efficient, and robust test scripts that can cater to diverse web testing scenarios.
I look forward to showcasing my test automation capabilities and the value I can bring to any organization or project.

Please enjoy exploring my test automation portfolio project,
and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.
