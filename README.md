 Test Automation Samples: Showcasing example projects and expertise in Robot Framework &amp; Python. Explore, learn, and collaborate!



Welcome to my Test Automation Portfolio Repository!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of example projects showcasing my test automation expertise in Robot Framework and Python. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate different approaches to test automation, from single test cases to more complex, data-driven styles.

Each example project in this repository is organized as follows:

A dedicated folder for each example page, which includes the test automation code, test plan, and related resources.
A test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, and test cases for the example page.
Test results from executed Robot runs, providing an insight into the test execution process and outcomes.
Feel free to explore these example projects, learn from them, and collaborate. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to feedback and eager to learn from the test automation community.

Happy testing!
