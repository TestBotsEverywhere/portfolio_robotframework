 Test Automation Samples: Showcasing example projects and expertise in Robot Framework &amp; Python. Explore, learn, and collaborate!



Welcome to my Test Automation Portfolio Repository!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of example projects showcasing my test automation expertise in Robot Framework and Python. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate different approaches to test automation, from single test cases to more complex, data-driven styles.

Each example project in this repository is organized as follows:

A dedicated folder for each example page, which includes the test automation code, test plan, and related resources.
A test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, and test cases for the example page.
Test results from executed Robot runs, providing an insight into the test execution process and outcomes.
Feel free to explore these example projects, learn from them, and collaborate. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to feedback and eager to learn from the test automation community.

Happy testing!


**Requirements:**

To run the test automation scripts from this project in your own environment, you will need to set up the following prerequisites:

Python: The Robot Framework is built on top of Python, and it's essential to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Robot Framework: Install the Robot Framework using the following pip command in your terminal or command prompt:
**pip install robotframework**

Node.js: As the Browser Library is built on top of the Playwright library, which requires Node.js, you will need to install Node.js. Download and install the latest version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Robot Framework Browser Library: Install the Browser Library using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
**pip install robotframework-browser**

Then, run the following command to install the required Playwright browser binaries:
**rfbrowser init**

Additional Libraries: Depending on the specific test cases, additional libraries may be required. Each .robot file will include a documentation section detailing any extra libraries needed for the respective test cases. Please refer to the documentation section in each .robot file and install the necessary libraries accordingly.

Once you have set up the required components, you can execute the test automation scripts in your environment. The comprehensive web testing project should provide valuable insights into the capabilities of the Robot Framework and Browser Library when applied to diverse web testing scenarios.
